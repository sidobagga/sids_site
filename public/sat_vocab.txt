The following text is adapted from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s 1837 story “Dr. Heidegger’s Experiment.” The main character, a
physician, is experimenting with rehydrating a dried flower.
At first [the rose] lay lightly on the surface of the fluid, appearing to imbibe none of its moisture. Soon, however, a
singular change began to be visible. The crushed and dried petals stirred and assumed a deepening tinge of crimson,
as if the flower were reviving from a deathlike slumber.
As used in the text, what does the phrase “a singular” most nearly mean?
A. A lonely
B. A disagreeable
C. An acceptable
D. An extraordinary
ID: 359902ae Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “singular” most nearly means extraordinary. The text portrays an
experiment in which a character rehydrates a dried rose by infusing it with moisture. After prolonged contact with the liquid,
the rose begins to absorb it, undergoing an exceptional transformation: its color deepens, its previously “crushed and dried”
petals shift, and the entire flower revives “from a deathlike slumber.” In other words, an extraordinary change is visible in the
flower.
Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts “singular” can mean of or relating to an individual or to a single instance of
something, this usage doesn’t imply loneliness or an otherwise unsatisfactory condition of isolation. Moreover, the text
doesn’t attribute such a condition to the rose. Choice B is incorrect. Although “singular” has several related meanings, none
of them relate to being disagreeable or unpleasant. Moreover, the text doesn’t portray the change undergone by the rose as
necessarily disagreeable. Choice C is incorrect because “singular” means extraordinary, not acceptable. The change is
portrayed as striking, not barely satisfactory.

Question ID 22a41819

Rejecting the premise that the literary magazine Ebony and Topaz (1927) should present a unified vision of Black American
identity, editor Charles S. Johnson fostered his contributors’ diverse perspectives by promoting their authorial autonomy.
Johnson’s self-effacement diverged from the editorial stances of W.E.B. Du Bois and Alain Locke, whose decisions for their
publications were more ______.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. proficient
B. dogmatic
C. ambiguous
D. unpretentious
ID: 22a41819 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer. A person who is "dogmatic" believes strongly that their principles and opinions are true.
Because Du Bois and Locke are implied to have one "unified vision" of Black American identity that they prioritize over the
"diverse perspectives" of different writers, they can be described as dogmatic.
Choice A is incorrect. "Proficient" means "skilled." Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text
suggests that Johnson was not skilled at making editorial decisions. Based on the text, the three editors just have different
styles; they’re not necessarily more or less skilled. Choice C is incorrect. "Ambiguous" means "unclear" or "open to multiple
interpretations." However, it’s actually Johnson who encouraged multiple interpretations ("diverse perspectives"). Since Du
Bois and Locke are said to "diverge" from Johnson, we can assume that the views they published were not ambiguous, but
instead clear and firm (a "unified vision"). Choice D is incorrect. "Unpretentious" means "not trying to impress others with
greater skill or importance than is actually possessed." Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the
text suggests that Johnson is pretentious (trying to impress others).

Drivers who strongly believe that the toll they must pay to use the Lewis and Clark Bridge, which spans the Ohio River to
connect Indiana and Kentucky, is currently too high are unlikely to be ______ a proposal to increase the toll. Advocates for a
higher toll are likely to have more success if they instead direct their arguments toward a more persuadable segment of the
population. 
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. receptive to
B. apprised of
C. incensed by
D. cited in
ID: f0be91b2 Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of driver attitudes toward a toll
increase. In this context, "receptive to" would mean open to or willing to consider something. The text focuses on drivers who
think the current toll for the Lewis and Clark Bridge is too high, suggesting that advocates for increasing that toll would have
better success presenting their arguments to "a more persuadable segment of the population" rather than to those drivers.
This context suggests that the drivers who strongly believe the toll is already too high are not persuadable—that is, that they
are unlikely to be willing to consider the toll-increase proposal.
Choice B is incorrect because "apprised of" means informed about or made aware of something, and nothing in the text
suggests that the drivers who think a toll is already too high wouldn’t be informed of a proposal for an even higher toll; in
fact, the text implies that advocates of the proposal would "direct their arguments" in favor of the increase to those drivers,
even though they would likely be more successful focusing on people who are more open to hearing their arguments. Choice
C is incorrect. In this context, "incensed by" would mean angered or outraged by something. The text focuses on drivers who
feel that a current toll is too high, and it wouldn’t make sense to suggest that those drivers would be unlikely to be angered by
a proposal for the toll to be increased; indeed, drivers who think the toll is already too high likely would be angered by a move
to raise it even higher. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, "cited in" would mean referred to or mentioned in something.
Although it’s reasonable to suggest that a proposal to raise a toll might not make any mention of drivers who think the toll is
already too high, the text focuses on how those drivers and other people are likely to react to arguments in favor of the
proposal, not on whether those drivers would be cited in the proposal itself.

Economist Marco Castillo and colleagues showed that nuisance costs—the time and effort people must spend to make
donations—reduce charitable giving. Charities can mitigate this effect by compensating donors for nuisance costs, but those
costs, though variable, are largely ______ donation size, so charities that compensate donors will likely favor attracting a few
large donors over many small donors.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. supplemental to
B. predictive of
C. independent of
D. subsumed in
ID: 5e57efec Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer. We’re told that charities that pay donors back for nuisance costs will attract a few large donors
instead of many small donors. This suggests that nuisance costs are not linked to donation size.
Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t fit the logic of the text. If nuisance costs are supplemental to (meaning in addition to)
donation size, that wouldn’t result in charities that compensate donors for those costs attracting a few large donors over
many small donors. Choice B is incorrect. This doesn’t fit the logic of the text. If nuisance costs can predict donation size,
that wouldn’t necessarily result in charities that compensate donors for those costs attracting a few large donors over many
small donors. Choice D is incorrect. This doesn’t fit the logic of the text. If nuisance costs are subsumed in (meaning
included in) donation size, that wouldn’t result in charities that compensate donors for those costs attracting a few large
donors over many small donors.

During a 2014 archaeological dig in Spain, Vicente Lull and his team uncovered the skeleton of a woman from El Algar, an
Early Bronze Age society, buried with valuable objects signaling a high position of power. This finding may persuade
researchers who have argued that Bronze Age societies were ruled by men to ______ that women may have also held
leadership roles.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. waive
B. concede
C. refute
D. require
ID: 757077f9 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the significance of the 2014
archaeological finding at El Algar. In this context, “concede” means to admit something is true after first resisting that
admission. The text indicates that some researchers believe “Bronze Age societies were ruled by men.” But the Bronze Age
burial of a woman at El Algar included “valuable objects signaling a high position of power,” which would raise the possibility
that “women may have also held leadership roles.” Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were
leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion.
Choice A is incorrect because “waive” means to refrain from insisting that something, such as a right or a requirement, be
observed; the word isn’t used, however, in contexts where someone acknowledges that an opinion they hold may be invalid,
as is the case in the text. Choice C is incorrect. According to the text, the finding from the El Algar burial site undermines the
view that Bronze Age societies were exclusively ruled by men. However, “refute” means to demonstrate that something is
false and would not make sense in context. Lull and team’s finding supports the view that women may have also held
leadership roles, not that they did not participate in such roles. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “require” means
to demand or specify as mandatory. However, it would not make sense for contemporary researchers to demand that Bronze
Age “women may have also held leadership roles.”

The following text is adapted from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s 1844 short story “Drowne’s Wooden Image.” Drowne, a young man,
is carving a wooden figure to decorate the front of a ship.
Day by day, the work assumed greater precision, and settled its irregular and misty outline into distincter grace and beauty.
The general design was now obvious to the common eye.
As used in the text, what does the word “assumed” most nearly mean?
A. Acquired
B. Acknowledged
C. Imitated
D. Speculated
ID: 84ece3f6 Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, “assumed” most nearly means acquired, or came to possess. The
text portrays a character named Drowne carving a figure out of wood. At first “irregular and misty,” or haphazard and
indistinct, the figure’s outline gradually showed “distincter grace and beauty” until the general design of the carved object
“was now obvious to the common eye,” or plainly recognizable to anyone. In other words, as Drowne continued to carve, the
wooden object came to possess, or acquired, greater precision, changing from an indistinct outline or shape into a graceful,
beautiful, and clearly recognizable form.
Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “assumed” can mean acknowledged, or recognized, it doesn’t have that
meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden figure can’t acknowledge its own precision. Choice C is
incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the wooden figure merely imitated, or mimicked, precision.
Rather, the text suggests that as Drowne carved his wooden figure, it gradually became more precise. Choice D is incorrect.
Although in some contexts “assumed” can mean speculated, or supposed based on incomplete information, it doesn’t have
that meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden figure can’t speculate about its own precision.

Businesses typically try to promote themselves, but research by Michael Luca, Abhishek Nagaraj, and Gauri Subramani
suggests that some do not ______ their marketing. The researchers studied restaurants in Texas and found that those listed
on a popular review website (which can be done at no cost) had revenue increases of 5 percent on average, but 33 percent of
restaurants studied never listed on the site.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. adorn
B. optimize
C. endorse
D. counteract
ID: 6c086e70 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of business marketing practices. In
this context, "optimize" means make the most effective possible use of available opportunities. The text indicates that
though businesses typically try to promote themselves, they don’t always make use of effective tools for doing so, pointing
to research showing that 33 percent of restaurants failed to use a free listing service that increased revenue by 5 percent on
average for restaurants that did use the service. The text therefore suggests that by foregoing a free and effective marketing
tool, some businesses aren’t making the best use of, or optimizing, marketing opportunities.
Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "adorn" would mean decorate or enhance the appearance of, and there’s
nothing in the text to suggest that by failing to use a free and effective promotional tool, some businesses aren’t enhancing
the appearance of their own marketing. The example in the text illustrates that some businesses aren’t utilizing an effective
marketing opportunity, not that they aren’t improving the appearance of their marketing. Choice C is incorrect because in this
context, "endorse" would mean openly approve or recommend, and the text’s discussion of the fact that some businesses
have overlooked an effective marketing tool doesn’t support the idea that those businesses therefore don’t approve of their
own marketing. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, saying that businesses don’t "counteract" their marketing
would suggest that they don’t actively undermine it or make it ineffective. The text begins by stating that businesses typically
try to promote themselves but then continues to imply that some businesses fail to take advantage of good opportunities to
do so, citing the example of businesses that failed to use a free and effective marketing tool. Though it’s possible that those
businesses that did use the site therefore didn’t unintentionally counteract their own marketing, the first sentence conveys
that the text’s focus is on things that some businesses do and that some businesses don’t do when trying to promote
themselves, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that any businesses would actively try to undermine their own marketing in
pursuit of that goal.

The following text is adapted from George Eliot’s 1871–72 novel Middlemarch.
[Mr. Brooke] had travelled in his younger years, and was held in this part of the country to have contracted a too
rambling habit of mind. Mr. Brooke’s conclusions were as difficult to predict as the weather.
As used in the text, what does the word “contracted” most nearly mean?
A. Restricted
B. Described
C. Developed
D. Settled
ID: e459076b Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “contracted” most nearly means developed. The text explains that
Mr. Brooke has a “too rambling habit of mind,” which the text likens to a disease, saying he is thought to have contracted it.
To contract a disease means to acquire or develop a disease. In other words, the text indicates that Mr. Brooke is believed to
have acquired, or developed, the habit of mind described in the text.
Choice A is incorrect. Although “contracted” can mean limited or restricted in some contexts, here Mr. Brooke is said to draw
unpredictable conclusions, suggesting that he exhibits this “too rambling habit of mind,” not that it has been somehow
limited or restricted. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text describes Mr. Brooke’s habit of mind, nothing suggests that
those are his descriptions or, indeed, that he described his habit of mind at all. Choice D is incorrect because settled means
calmed or mitigated, but here Mr. Brooke is said to draw unpredictable conclusions, suggesting that he exhibits this “too
rambling habit of mind,” not that it has been somehow calmed or mitigated.

In a study of residential mobility in Washington, DC, LaTanya Brown-Robertson et al. found that increases in household
spending power (via tax credits) had mixed effects on mobility decisions, possibly because residential location choices are
not fully reducible to economic factors but are also ______ noneconomic factors such as access to strong local social
networks.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. transposed with
B. mediated by
C. decoupled from
D. antecedent to
ID: 5a97d9cd Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of residential mobility decisions. In
this context, "mediated by" means influenced or affected by something. The text establishes that increasing household
spending power (an economic factor) produced "mixed effects" on mobility decisions. The text then explains that residential
choices are "not fully reducible to economic factors," which means that these decisions don’t simply rely on how much
money is available to spend on a residential move but on other factors as well. According to the text, noneconomic
considerations, such as access to social networks, also play a significant role. Thus, "mediated by" accurately captures this
relationship where noneconomic factors influence what might otherwise be purely economic decisions.
Choice A is incorrect because "transposed with" would suggest that economic and noneconomic factors are being switched
or interchanged when making residential mobility decisions, which wouldn’t make logical sense in this context. The text
indicates that these factors coexist and jointly influence such decisions. Choice C is incorrect. The phrase "decoupled from"
means separated or disconnected from, which would suggest that economic factors are completely separate from
noneconomic factors. This would contradict the text’s main point that residential mobility decisions involve multiple factors
being considered simultaneously rather than in isolation. Choice D is incorrect because "antecedent to," which means
something prior or earlier, would indicate that noneconomic factors come before economic ones in time or sequence. The
text doesn’t establish this chronological relationship. Instead, the text indicates that economic factors (household spending
power) and noneconomic factors (access to social networks) simultaneously influence residential mobility decisions.

Correct Answer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer. Based on the text, we’re looking for a word that means something similar to "mak[ing] use of
insights and techniques from all those fields." "Transcending" means "going beyond," so "transcending traditional boundaries"
would mean crossing into all those various fields of research, which is exactly the meaning we want.
Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t a logical word choice. Based on the text, we’re looking for a word that means something
similar to "mak[ing] use of insights and techniques from all those fields." To "epitomize" means to "be a perfect example of,"
so "epitomizing traditional boundaries" would mean the opposite of what we want: keeping the fields of research separate.
Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t a logical word choice. Based on the text, we’re looking for a word that means something

and would result in a confusing sentence with an unclear meaning. Choice D is incorrect. This isn’t a logical word choice.

The fossil remains of the individual known as Oase 1, discovered in Romania in 2002, can help paleoanthropologists not only
______ steps in the evolution of hominids but also illuminate the Pleistocene epoch generally, revealing important details
about the time in which Oase 1 lived.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. exploit
B. discern
C. prioritize
D. yield
ID: adc8ea28 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the utility of the Oase 1 fossil to
paleoanthropologists. As used in this context, "discern" means to detect or recognize something, especially something
hidden or obscure. The text indicates that the Oase 1 fossil can help paleoanthropologists recognize patterns in the
evolutionary process and shed light on ("illuminate") the period in which Oase 1 lived. Thus, the fossil will enable researchers
to gain insights into, or discern, facts that are still not well understood.
Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "exploit" would suggest that the paleoanthropologists are using "steps in the
evolution of hominids," which does not make logical sense. Rather, the text is about how the Oase 1 fossil could help
paleoanthropologists learn about hominid evolution and the Pleistocene epoch more generally. Choice C is incorrect
because in this context, "prioritize" would suggest that either the paleoanthropologists are placing more importance on
"steps in the evolution of hominids" than they are on something else not identified in the text or that they are placing these
steps in some sort of order. Rather, the text is about how the Oase 1 fossil could help paleoanthropologists learn about
hominid evolution and the Pleistocene epoch more generally. Choice D is incorrect because to say that paleoanthropologists
could "yield" or generate "steps in the evolution of hominids" doesn’t make sense. The researchers may develop new insights
into those evolutionary steps, but they do not create those steps themselves. Rather, the context makes it clear that they are
detecting or discovering patterns based on their study of the Oase 1 fossil.

within his tribe’s traditional beliefs while simultaneously expressing his distaste for being in wilderness settings himself.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. responsiveness to
B. ambivalence toward
C. renunciation of
D. mastery over
ID: e0656211 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s description of how Pico feels about the natural
world. In this context, to say that Pico portrays his “ambivalence toward” nature would mean that he portrays his mixed
feelings about nature. The text explains that Pico “honors the centrality of nature” and also makes it clear that he doesn’t
enjoy being in nature. This context suggests that Pico feels ambivalence toward nature.
Choice A is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “responsiveness to” nature would mean that he portrays himself
as quick to react to nature, which isn’t supported by the text. Instead, the text focuses on Pico’s mixed feelings toward
nature, describing him as both honoring nature’s role in his tribe’s beliefs and expressing his personal dislike for being in
nature. Choice C is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “renunciation of” nature would mean that he portrays
himself as rejecting nature, which isn’t supported by the text. The text conveys that Pico demonstrates both positive and
negative responses toward nature, not that he’s giving it up completely. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Pico
portrays his “mastery over” nature would mean that he portrays himself as having control over nature, which isn’t supported
by the text. The text focuses on Pico’s mixed feelings about nature; nothing in the text suggests that Pico feels mastery over
nature.

While scholars believe many Mesoamerican cities influenced each other, direct evidence of such influence is difficult to

(Mexico) architecture—including a near replica of a famed Teotihuacán temple—providing tangible evidence of outside
influence in portions of Tikal.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. refinements of
B. precursors of
C. commonalities with
D. animosities toward
ID: 54804e10 Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of architectural influences among
Mesoamerican cities. In this context, “commonalities with” means similarities to or shared attributes with. The text indicates
that a recently discovered citadel in Tikal includes a close imitation of a famous temple in Teotihuacán (another
Mesoamerican city) and other evidence of Teotihuacán influence, which suggests that the citadel possesses features that
resemble architectural features found in Teotihuacán. This context thus indicates that the Tikal citadel shows commonalities
with Teotihuacán architecture.
Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text that suggests that the Tikal citadel shows “refinements of,” or
improvements on, Teotihuacán architecture. Although the text suggests that the architecture of Teotihuacán influenced the
architecture of the Tikal citadel, and although it’s possible that later architectural designs could make improvements on
earlier designs, the text doesn’t discuss whether, in imitating Teotihuacán architecture, the Tikal citadel’s builders improved
on it. Choice B is incorrect because describing the citadel in Tikal as showing “precursors of” Teotihuacán architecture—or
features that preceded and foreshadowed those of Teotihuacán architecture—would imply the opposite of what the text
suggests about the relationship between the architecture found in Tikal and Teotihuacán. The text claims that the discovery
of similarities between the Tikal citadel and the architecture of Teotihuacán, including a replica of a temple in Teotihuacán,
provides evidence of outside influences on Tikal architecture. If the Tikal citadel was influenced by Teotihuacán architecture,
then the Teotihuacán architecture must predate the citadel, not the other way around. In this context, therefore, it wouldn’t
make sense to say that the Tikal citadel shows precursors of Teotihuacán architecture. Choice D is incorrect because the
text discusses how the citadel in Tikal indicates the influence of Teotihuacán architecture, which implies that the makers of
the Tikal citadel likely admired aspects of Teotihuacán architecture enough to imitate it. Thus, there’s no reason to think that
the Tikal citadel provides evidence of the Tikal people’s “animosities toward,” or feelings of strong dislike or hostility toward,
Teotihuacán architecture.

The following text is from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 1925 novel The Great Gatsby.
[Jay Gatsby] was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so
peculiarly American—that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more, with the formless
grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the

B. Prestige
C. Characteristic
D. Accomplishment
ID: 9aa44886 Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer. “This quality” refers to Gatsby’s “resourcefulness of movement,” which is described as a
characteristic or trait of his. 
Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t what “quality” means in this context. Here, “this quality” refers to Gatsby’s “resourcefulness of
movement,” which is described as a characteristic or trait of his. “Standard” is a synonym for a different definition of
“quality”: the degree of excellence of something. Choice B is incorrect. This isn’t what “quality” means in this context. Here,
“this quality” refers to Gatsby’s “resourcefulness of movement,” which is described as a characteristic or trait of his.
“Prestige” would suggest a high status or an admirable reputation, which doesn’t match that description. Choice D is
incorrect. This isn’t what “quality” means in this context. Here, “this quality” refers to Gatsby’s “resourcefulness of
movement,” which is described as a characteristic or trait of his. “Accomplishment” would suggest an achievement, which

As used in the text, what does the word “consider” most nearly mean?
A. Take into account and follow
B. Admire steadily and praise
C. Come to a decision about
D. Have an opinion on
ID: ab1bd603 Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "consider" most nearly means to take into account and follow. The
text explains that Marija’s job was to make sure that her sister’s wedding proceeded in certain ways ("in due form") and that
she loudly directed everyone’s actions all day. The text then indicates that Marija was so focused on ensuring that others
"conformed to the proprieties"—that is, that they behaved in appropriate ways—that she failed to "consider them herself"; that
is, she didn’t take standards of appropriate behavior into account and follow them in her own actions.
Choice B is incorrect. In some contexts, "consider" can mean to think about something in a positive way—which can involve
admiration—but the text doesn’t suggest that Marija was so busy imposing "proprieties" (standards of appropriate behavior)
on others that she didn’t admire and praise them herself. The context suggests it’s more likely that Marija did speak
positively of "due form" and "the best home traditions" while ensuring others behaved in certain ways. Choice C is incorrect.
In some contexts, "consider" can mean to come to a decision, but the text doesn’t suggest that Marija wasn’t able to make a
decision for herself about the "proprieties" (standards of appropriate behavior) she ensured everyone else conformed to.
Rather, the context conveys that Marija knew very clearly which behaviors others should follow as "due form" and "the best
home traditions." Choice D is incorrect. In some contexts, "consider" can mean to have an opinion, but the text doesn’t
suggest that Marija wasn’t able to have an opinion on the "proprieties" (standards of appropriate behavior) she was ensuring
others conformed to. Rather, the context conveys that Marija had strong feelings about which behaviors were "due form" and
"the best home traditions."

To develop a method for measuring snow depth with laser beams, NASA physicist Yongxiang Hu relied on ______; identifying
broad similarities between two seemingly different phenomena, Hu used information about how ants move inside colonies
to calculate how the particles of light that make up laser beams travel through snow.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. a collaboration
B. an accessory
C. a contradiction
D. an analogy
ID: e8c26398 Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer. The text after the semicolon tells us that Hu "identif[ied] broad similarities between two
seemingly different phenomena," comparing ants with light particles. Since an analogy seeks similarities between seemingly
unrelated phenomena, this fits the context perfectly.
Choice A is incorrect. "A collaboration" refers to "an act of working with others," but what comes after the semicolon doesn’t
describe collaboration with other researchers. Instead, it shows a comparison between two different (but ultimately similar)
scientific phenomena. Choice B is incorrect. "An accessory" can refer to "something added to increase attractiveness or
usefulness." No accessories are described in this text. Choice C is incorrect. "A contradiction" means "a set of ideas or things
that are opposed to or inconsistent with each other." The text describes how Hu used the similarity between ant and light
particle movement to develop his method, so a word that refers to difference would not make sense here.

Text corpora such as the Bank of English are enormous collections of electronically stored texts that can be used for
empirical testing of hypotheses regarding the frequency of typical word usage. If one has a ______ that the word “get” has a
high incidence in English, for example, an analysis of a corpus can support that hypothesis by showing that “get” is the fifth
most commonly used verb.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. recognition
B. scheme
C. supposition
D. synopsis
ID: 10c236ce Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of testing hypotheses regarding usage
by means of text corpora. In this context, "supposition" refers to an assumption or hypothesis that is not yet proven. The text
explains that text corpora can be used for "empirical testing of hypotheses regarding the frequency of typical word usage"
and then provides a specific example of using corpus analysis to support a claim about the word "get." The word
"supposition" precisely conveys this idea of an assumption or hypothesis about word frequency that can then be tested
against empirical data.
Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that someone has a "recognition" that the word "get" has a high
incidence in English. Recognition implies acknowledging something already established as true or valid, but the text
indicates that corpus analysis is needed to support the claim about "get," suggesting its high frequency wasn’t already
established or previously known. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that someone has a "scheme"
that the word "get" has a high incidence in English. A scheme is a plan or systematic arrangement, but the context indicates
what’s needed is a preliminary hypothesis that can be tested with corpus data, not a plan related to word frequency. Choice D
is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that someone has a "synopsis" that the word "get" has a high incidence in
English. A synopsis is a summary or outline, but the text is discussing an initial hypothesis about word frequency that
requires testing, not a condensed statement of existing information.

photography as an emerging medium for fine art: in the essay, Eastlake ______ that the value of photographs was
informational rather than creative.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. exposed
B. asserted
C. discovered
D. doubted
ID: 8b46bb51 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer. "Asserted" means "stated confidently." Eastlake "did not hesitate to publish reviews going
against popular opinion," so we can assume that she was confident in sharing her opinions.
Choice A is incorrect. "Exposed" means "made visible by uncovering" and, when talking about ideas, tends to be used in
relation to uncovering the truth. Eastlake was sharing an opinion, not uncovering a truth. Choice C is incorrect. "Discovered"
means "found," but Eastlake was writing an opinion essay. She was writing her own opinion, not "discovering" a new universal
truth. Choice D is incorrect. "Doubted" means "didn’t believe in." We’re told that Eastlake "questioned" the idea that
photography could be fine art. Placing "doubted" in the blank would actually suggest that Eastlake argued that photos were
valuable for creativity and not for information, which is the opposite of what we were told she believes.

the California county’s farms, residences, and businesses. It was ______ for a business to be featured, since being included
suggested that a business was an important part of the community.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. risky
B. misleading
C. advantageous
D. unremarkable
ID: ce8c03a8 Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of businesses being featured in The
Illustrated History of San Mateo County. In this context, "advantageous" means beneficial or providing a favorable position.
The text explains that being included in the book "suggested that a business was an important part of the community," and it
can be inferred that an enhanced reputation within the local community would benefit a business, commercially or
otherwise. This context supports the idea that being featured in this publication would be advantageous.
Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "risky" would suggest that being featured in The Illustrated History of San
Mateo County might have negative consequences for a business. However, the text implies only positive outcomes since
inclusion indicated importance within the local community. Choice B is incorrect because "misleading" would mean
deceptive or deliberately giving a wrong impression, but the text doesn’t indicate there was something deceptive about being
featured in The Illustrated History of San Mateo County; rather, it suggests that inclusion indicated community importance.
Choice D is incorrect because "unremarkable" would mean common or ordinary, which doesn’t make sense in context. The
text suggests that inclusion in The Illustrated History of San Mateo County instead conferred a special status on a business
by conveying its importance in the local community.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. negating 
B. prefiguring
C. entrenching
D. substantiating
ID: c14daa3c Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer. "Negating" means "reversing" or "making invalid." Proving that Vermeer worked with students
would reverse the view of him as a solitary artist.
Choice B is incorrect. "Prefiguring" means "being an early indicator of." There already existed views of Vermeer as a solitary
painter, so a new painting would not be an early indicator of those views. Rather, a painting proving that Vermeer had a
student would contradict those earlier views. Choice C is incorrect. "Entrenching" means "solidifying." A painting proving that
Vermeer had a student would not solidify views of him as solitary, but would rather contradict those views. Choice D is
incorrect. "Substantiating" means "supporting with proof." A painting proving that Vermeer had a student would not support
views of him as solitary, but would rather contradict those views.

Stephen Hannock’s luminous landscape paintings are appealing to viewers but have elicited little commentary from
contemporary critics, a phenomenon that may be due to the very fact that the paintings seem so ______. Many critics focus
their attention on art that is cryptic or overtly challenging. 
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. innovative
B. subversive
C. profound
D. accessible
ID: d3ca5d59 Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer. When talking about a thing, “accessible” means “easy to understand.” This sets up the contrast
in the next sentence, which tells us that critics mostly focus on art that is “cryptic or challenging” (meaning not easy to
understand).
Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t fit the logic of the text. The next sentence tells us that critics focus on art that is
mysterious and challenging. If Hannock’s paintings are “innovative” (meaning advanced and original), then critics probably
would comment on them. Choice B is incorrect. This doesn’t fit the logic of the text. The next sentence tells us that critics
focus on art that is mysterious and challenging. If Hannock’s paintings are “subversive” (meaning disruptive and
revolutionary), then critics probably would comment on them. Choice C is incorrect. This doesn’t fit the logic of the text. The
next sentence tells us that critics focus on art that is mysterious and challenging. If Hannock’s paintings are “profound”
(meaning very deep and insightful), then critics probably would comment on them.

The following text is adapted from Oscar Wilde’s 1895 play The Importance of Being Earnest.
CECILY: Have we got to part?
ALGERNON: I am afraid so. It’s a very painful parting.
CECILY: It is always painful to part from people whom one has known for a very brief space of time. The absence of old
friends one can endure with equanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been
introduced is almost unbearable.
As used in the text, what does the word “endure” most nearly mean?
A. Regret
B. Persist
C. Tolerate
D. Encourage
ID: 3566120b Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “endure” most nearly means tolerate. In the text, Cecily and
Algernon discuss parting, or saying goodbye. Cecily remarks on the deep pain of saying goodbye to people whom one has
only known briefly and then comments on the equanimity, or calm steadiness, one experiences when separated from old
friends. The text sets up an ironic contrast: one can easily tolerate, or put up with, the absence of close friends, but even a
very short separation from a new acquaintance is unbearable.
Choice A is incorrect. Nothing in the text suggests that Cecily associates regret, or a feeling of sorrow, with the absence of
old friends. Rather, the text sets up an ironic contrast between the feeling of calm steadiness one feels when separated from
old friends and the unbearable pain of being separated from new acquaintances. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some
contexts “endure” can mean persist, or proceed stubbornly, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because what is
being endured is the absence of old friends. Whereas one can persist despite the absence of someone else, one can’t persist
the absence itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t convey that Cecily encourages, or urges, old friends to be
absent. Although it may be that Cecily prefers new acquaintances to friends she has known for a long time, the text focuses
on her feelings as a result of others’ absences, not on her treatment of others.

Containing over 160 billion base pairs of DNA resulting from polyploidy (whole genome duplication) and accumulation of
noncoding DNA without significant deletion, the genome of Tmesipteris oblanceolata (New Caledonian fork fern) is the
largest known among eukaryotes—and, given the high biological costs of extremely large genomes, is unlikely to be ______. 
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. protracted
B. superseded
C. curtailed
D. obviated
ID: bbb77c84 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the fork fern’s enormous genome. In
this context, "superseded" means surpassed or exceeded by something else. The text establishes that this plant has "the
largest known" genome among eukaryotes and mentions "the high biological costs of extremely large genomes," suggesting
there are natural constraints that make it biologically disadvantageous to maintain such massive genetic material. This
context supports the idea that it’s unlikely another organism will evolve an even larger genome that would replace this plant’s
record—that is, its status as having the largest genome is unlikely to be superseded.
Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "protracted" would mean drawn out over time or space, and the text focuses on
the record size of the New Caledonian fork fern’s genome and the fact that extremely large genomes carry "high biological
costs." This information suggests that the biological upper limit for genome size may have been reached and that the New
Caledonian fork fern’s genome is therefore unlikely to be surpassed, or superseded, not that it’s unlikely to be protracted.
Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "curtailed" would mean cut short or reduced, and the text focuses on the record
size of the New Caledonian fork fern’s genome and the fact that extremely large genomes carry "high biological costs." This
information suggests that the biological upper limit for genome size may have been reached and that the New Caledonian
fork fern’s genome is therefore unlikely to be surpassed, or superseded, not that it’s unlikely to be curtailed. Choice D is
incorrect because in this context, "obviated" would mean made unnecessary or redundant, and the text focuses on the
record size of the New Caledonian fork fern’s genome and the fact that extremely large genomes carry "high biological
costs." This information suggests that the biological upper limit for genome size may have been reached and that the New
Caledonian fork fern’s genome is therefore unlikely to be surpassed, or superseded, not that it’s unlikely to be obviated.

The discoverers of the minor planet 1227 Geranium named it after the plant genus that includes cranesbills. Most of the
recently discovered minor planets, however, are given only an identification number, largely due to there being over 500,000
such bodies known at present, which makes the already challenging task of finding a unique name for each nearly ______.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. insurmountable
B. feasible
C. substantial
D. unnecessary
ID: 35fd0eb4 Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the difficulty in naming a large
number of minor planets. In this context, "insurmountable" means impossible to overcome or too difficult to solve. The text
establishes that coming up with distinct names for minor planets is already a difficult task that has become even more
challenging because there are now more than 500,000 known minor planets. The logical conclusion is that finding unique
names for such a vast number of celestial objects has become virtually impossible—or insurmountable—which explains why
the majority of recently discovered minor planets receive only identification numbers instead of proper names.
Choice B is incorrect because "feasible" means possible to do or achieve, which would contradict the logic of the text. The
text indicates that the task of naming minor planets has become more difficult because of their large number. The text then
explains that this is why most new discoveries receive only identification numbers. If the task were feasible, there would be
no reason to abandon the practice of giving proper names to minor planets in favor of using only numbers. Choice C is
incorrect because "substantial" means considerable in size, amount, or importance. While the text does suggest that naming
all minor planets would be a significant undertaking, describing the task as substantial wouldn’t logically explain why the
naming practice has been largely abandoned in favor of using only identification numbers. The text suggests that the task
has become virtually impossible (insurmountable), not merely large or significant. Choice D is incorrect because
"unnecessary," which means not needed, would suggest that giving proper names to minor planets serves no purpose.
However, the text doesn’t question the value or purpose of naming minor planets; rather, it explains that the sheer number of
discoveries has made the already challenging naming task nearly impossible to complete. The text provides an example of a
named minor planet (1227 Geranium), indicating that naming has been considered worthwhile but has become impractical
because of the volume.

Scholarly discussions of gender in Shakespeare’s comedies often celebrate the rebellion of the playwright’s characters
against the rigid expectations ______ by Elizabethan society. Most of the comedies end in marriage, with characters returning
to their socially dictated gender roles after previously defying them, but there are some notable exceptions.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. interjected
B. committed
C. illustrated
D. prescribed
ID: a60b0004 Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of gender roles in Shakespeare’s
comedies. As used in this context, “prescribed” would mean laid down as rules. The text indicates that the characters in the
comedies often defy gender roles that are “socially dictated” (even if most characters do return to those roles eventually)
and that scholars have been very interested in these acts of defiance. This context indicates that what the characters are
rebelling against are standards of behavior prescribed by the society of the time.  
Choice A is incorrect because saying that expectations about gender were “interjected,” or suddenly inserted between other
things, wouldn’t make sense in context. There’s no suggestion in the text that the issue of gender roles was inserted between
other things or was an interruption in a larger discussion. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Shakespeare
depicts characters rebelling against expectations about gender that have been “socially dictated,” not expectations that
society has “committed,” or carried out, entrusted, or promised. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that
Shakespeare depicts characters rebelling against expectations about gender that have been “socially dictated,” not
expectations that have been “illustrated,” or clarified with examples. Although it’s possible for expectations about gender
roles to be illustrated, there’s nothing in the text to indicate that characters in Shakespeare’s comedies rebel against
illustrations of gender expectations.

Despite how ______ they may seem on first glance, the works of the philosopher Georg Hegel have proven to be quite
influential. Readers who manage to penetrate Hegel’s frustratingly dense prose often find that his thrillingly original and
profound ideas wind up shaping their own thinking.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. authoritative
B. opaque
C. empirical
D. facile
ID: a5e747f0 Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Hegel’s works. In this context,
"opaque" means difficult to understand or unclear. The text creates a contrast between the initial impression given by Hegel’s
works and their influence and insight, noting that readers must "penetrate Hegel’s frustratingly dense prose" to access his
important ideas. This context clearly establishes that Hegel’s writing is initially challenging to comprehend, or opaque.
Choice A is incorrect because "authoritative" means influential or clearly accurate. Hegel’s works may be authoritative, but it
wouldn’t make logical sense in context to say that although his works seem authoritative, they have been influential. Instead,
the text focuses on the fact that Hegel’s works are challenging to read, but that working through the dense prose can be
rewarding. Choice C is incorrect because referring to Hegel’s works as "empirical," which means factual or verifiable, would
suggest that they are based on observation or experience rather than theory. The text, however, doesn’t address this aspect
of Hegel’s philosophy. Instead, it focuses on the difficulty of understanding his writing. Choice D is incorrect because
describing Hegel’s works as "facile," which means superficial or simplistic, would directly contradict the text’s
characterization of his writing as "frustratingly dense" and requiring effort to understand.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. speculate about
B. dismiss
C. expand on
D. catalog
ID: fce80a36 Answer
Correct Answer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer. "Speculate" means "to form a theory or guess without any clear evidence." This makes sense
because, due to the lack of "clear evidence," the archaeologists can only guess how the pessoi set might have come to be
there.
Choice B is incorrect. "Dismiss" can mean "send away" or "treat as unworthy of consideration." The text implies that the
archaeologists are trying to figure out the truth—they wouldn’t "dismiss" what really happened. Choice C is incorrect. "Expand
on" means "give more details about," but there aren’t any details to give. Without any "clear evidence," the archaeologists can’t
give any more details. Choice D is incorrect. "Catalog" means "carefully record" or "make a list of." However, there’s no "clear

subject when they used modeling to determine a complex set of factors that could support planets’ development.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. a discernible
B. a straightforward
C. an inconclusive
D. an unbiased
ID: 5dce6cab Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s description of efforts to explain the existence of
planets in binary star systems. As used in this context, describing an explanation as “a straightforward” one would mean that
the explanation is direct and uncomplicated. The text asserts that since it should be “nearly impossible” for planets to form
in binary star systems, it’s “not surprising” that there isn’t a straightforward explanation for the existence of planets in such
systems; the fact that one potential approach involves “complex” factors offers further contextual support for this idea.
Choice A is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to say that there isn’t “a discernible” explanation—meaning
an explanation capable of being perceived—for the existence of planets in binary star systems. The text discusses just such
an explanation offered by Roman Rafikov and Kedron Silsbee, which indicates that their explanation can be
discerned. Choice C is incorrect because the text emphasizes how difficult it is to explain the existence of planets in binary
star systems, suggesting that the situation isn’t marked by the lack of “an inconclusive” explanation—an explanation that
does not resolve the issue—but rather that if any explanations have been offered, they’ve likely been inconclusive
ones. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there is a lack of “an unbiased,” or impartial and
unprejudiced, explanation for the existence of planets in binary star systems. The text indicates that it’s difficult to explain
the existence of planets in such systems and it describes one attempt to do so, but there is no evidence that explanations
from Roman Rafikov and Kedron Silsbee or others are biased.

Despite stated claims of global relevance, much major research on income inequality performed in the 2010s suffered from
a myopic focus on a few countries in North America and Western Europe, partly due to limited data availability. Researchers
would later ______ this shortcoming after gaining new access to banking records located in nations in Africa, such as Tunisia,
and Eastern Europe, such as Hungary.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. presuppose
B. categorize
C. mitigate
D. validate
ID: 83fd3cf4 Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of research on income inequality in the
2010s. In this context, "mitigate" means to make less severe or reduce the negative effects of something. The text first
identifies a shortcoming in the research: a "myopic focus on a few countries" despite claims of "global relevance." The text
then explains that researchers later gained access to new data from previously excluded regions (Africa and Eastern
Europe). This context supports the idea that with these new data, researchers would be able to reduce, or mitigate, the
identified shortcoming by incorporating a broader range of geographic regions into their studies of income inequality.
Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "presuppose" would mean to assume in advance that something is true, and it
wouldn’t make logical sense to say that researchers later assumed as true in advance a shortcoming they had already
encountered. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "categorize" would mean to classify or place into groups. The text
indicates that researchers did something about the shortcoming that characterized research on income inequality in the
2010s—limited geographic scope—after they gained access to new data from previously excluded regions. Categorizing a
shortcoming doesn’t require access to or analysis of new data; it could be done without any new information, but by
analyzing new data, researchers went beyond merely categorizing the shortcoming and instead took action to address it.
Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "validate" would mean to confirm or substantiate something. The text indicates
that researchers did something about a known shortcoming of research on income inequality in the 2010s—limited
geographic scope—after they gained access to new data from previously excluded regions. Confirming an already known
shortcoming doesn’t require access to or analysis of new data; it could be done without any new information, but by
analyzing new data, researchers went beyond merely validating the shortcoming and instead took action to make the
shortcoming less severe.

researchers found that elkhorn coral produced offspring that inherited somatic mutations from a parent.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. hypothesis
B. affinity
C. anomaly
D. corroboration
ID: e4f312c5 Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer. An "anomaly" is something that deviates from norms or expectations. In this case, the elkhorn
coral is an anomaly because it can pass on somatic mutations, whereas most other animals can’t.
Choice A is incorrect. A "hypothesis" is "a theory about something," but no theories are provided about elkhorn coral in this
text, just facts. Choice B is incorrect. "Affinity" represents "an inclination or liking toward something." As genetic mutations
tend to occur without any conscious effort, you can’t really have an inclination toward passing on somatic mutations. Choice
D is incorrect. "Corroboration" means "evidence to support or prove something." Because elkhorn coral do the opposite of
what most animals do, they do not provide corroboration of the theory that somatic mutations can’t be passed onto
offspring. Rather, they show the opposite.

idea.
Choice B is incorrect. This doesn’t make sense. John doesn’t want his mother to apologize for his own desire to travel—he
wants her to accept his desire to travel. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t suggest that John wants his mother to match
his desire to travel. Rather, he wants her to accept his desire to travel even though she doesn’t like it. Choice D is incorrect.
This is tempting, because it seems to pick up on the idea of people “reconciling” after a fight, but it actually doesn’t make
sense. The text never suggests that John’s mother was “united with” the idea of him traveling in the past—if anything, it
seems like she’s always been against it. Besides, it would be strange to say that a person “reunites with” a notion.

In the 2010s, the price of pop music cassette tapes from the 1980s and 1990s rose dramatically, which had the
counterintuitive effect of ______ demand: buyers who hadn’t previously wanted to purchase vintage cassettes thronged the
market, believing prices would continue to rise and the tapes could be resold later at a profit.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. exploiting
B. monetizing
C. appraising
D. engendering
ID: 4b54bbf0 Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how rising prices affected demand
for vintage cassette tapes. In this context, "engendering" means producing or causing to exist. The text indicates that the
effect of a dramatic increase in the price of vintage cassettes was counterintuitive, or contrary to what would typically be
expected. Generally, when prices rise, demand falls—but the text indicates that in this case, buyers who previously had no
interest in cassettes "thronged the market" (that is, many of them began purchasing cassettes) because they saw the
cassettes as potential investments. This context conveys that the rising prices surprisingly produced significant demand,
producing many new buyers for vintage cassettes.
Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on a rise in prices of vintage cassettes, and it wouldn’t make sense to
describe the price increase itself—rather than sellers of vintage cassettes—as "exploiting," or unfairly or selfishly taking
advantage of, demand. Further, wanting to take advantage of new demand would be a motivation for a price increase, not a
counterintuitive effect of it. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, "monetizing" would mean utilizing as a source of profit, and
it wouldn’t make sense to describe a price increase itself, rather than sellers of vintage cassettes, as using demand as a
source of profit; moreover, seeking to profit when there’s new demand would be a reason for price increases, not a
counterintuitive effect of them. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, "appraising" would mean assessing the value or
significance of something. The text focuses on a rise in prices of vintage cassettes, and while it would be reasonable to
suggest that sellers might have appraised demand for those cassettes, it wouldn’t make sense to suggest that a price
increase itself could do such an assessment; moreover, an appraisal of demand would most likely precede a price increase
rather than be an effect of it.

Austin McCoy has argued that historians have tended to ______ rank-and-file workers in analyses of changes in organized
labor in the United States in the decades following the Second World War, presenting political, business, and labor leaders as
the major actors and ordinary workers as nearly devoid of agency.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. epitomize
B. marginalize
C. extol
D. substantiate
ID: 1374a9fa Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how historians have treated rankand-file (ordinary) workers in their analyses. In this context, "marginalize" means treat as unimportant or relatively powerless
within a group or society. The text explains that according to Austin McCoy, historians have tended to treat "political,
business, and labor leaders" as the "major actors" involved in making changes in organized labor in the period after the
Second World War. By emphasizing the contributions of these leaders, historians have in effect minimized the contributions
of ordinary workers, treating them as relatively unimportant and "nearly devoid of agency," thereby marginalizing them.
Choice A is incorrect. In this context, "epitomize" would mean either serve as an ideal example of something or make into an
example of something, neither of which would make sense. In stating that historians have tended to characterize political,
business, and labor leaders as the primary actors responsible for changes in the post-Second World War labor movement in
a manner that minimizes the influence of ordinary workers, the text suggests that historians have tended to present ordinary
workers as unimportant to or uninfluential within the movement, not that historians themselves serve as examples of
ordinary workers, or that historians in their analyses have made ordinary workers into examples of the changes that
occurred. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "extol" would mean praise highly or glorify. The text states that
historians have tended to present ordinary workers as being "nearly devoid of agency," thereby minimizing their importance.
It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that in doing so, historians have tended to praise or glorify them. Choice D is
incorrect because "substantiate" would mean verify with evidence, and nothing in the text suggests that historians have
verified rank-and-file workers or their contributions in their analyses. If anything, the text suggests the opposite, implying that
by minimizing workers’ agency in organized labor, historians have likely overlooked evidence demonstrating their influence.

Some foraging models predict that the distance bees travel when foraging will decline as floral density increases, but
biologists Shalene Jha and Claire Kremen showed that bees’ behavior is inconsistent with this prediction if flowers in dense
patches are ______: bees will forage beyond patches of low species richness to acquire multiple resource types. 
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. depleted 
B. homogeneous
C. immature
D. dispersed
ID: 3d658a5a Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Jha and Kremen’s finding about
bees’ foraging behavior. In this context, “homogeneous” means uniform or of the same kind. The text indicates that some
models predict that the distance that bees travel when they’re foraging declines as the density of flowers increases. The text
goes on to say, however, that Jha and Kremen identified a circumstance in which bees don’t behave this way. Specifically, if
bees encounter “patches of low species richness”—that is, patches in which the flowers are largely from the same species—
they’ll travel beyond those patches to get varied food resources. This context thus suggests that bees don’t behave as some
models predict if the dense patches of flowers the bees encounter are homogeneous. 
Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave differently than some
models predict if the bees encounter flower patches that are not rich in species, not if the flowers are “depleted,” or emptied
or reduced in quality or quantity. Although it could be true that bees are likely to leave depleted patches in search of more
resources, the text doesn’t indicate that Jha and Kremen investigated that possibility. Choice C is incorrect because there’s
no information in the text suggesting that bees will not behave as some models predict if flowers in patches are “immature,”
or not fully developed. Instead, the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave contrary to some models’
predictions if the flower patches are not rich in species. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that bees’ behavior
will be inconsistent with the predictions of some models if the flower patches that the bees encounter are of low species
richness, not if the flowers are in patches that are “dispersed,” or widely scattered. Although the text does describe bees as
leaving patches that are not rich in species to forage elsewhere, there’s no suggestion that Jha and Kremen found that the
distance between dense flower patches affects whether the bees behave as some models predict.

Like the 1945 play it reimagines—Federico García Lorca’s The House of Bernarda Alba—Marcus Gardley’s 2014 play The
House That Will Not Stand prominently features women. In both plays, the all-female cast ______ an array of female
characters, including a strong mother and several daughters dealing with individual struggles.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. engulfs
B. encourages
C. comprises
D. provokes
ID: cd2ce51f Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Gardley’s play. In this context,
“comprises” means constitutes or makes up the totality of, and the text indicates that The House That Will Not Stand had an
“all-female cast” that stands in some relationship to “an array of female characters” in the play. Because all cast members
are female, the characters must be played by these female cast members; therefore the cast constitutes, or comprises, the
collection of characters.
Choice A is incorrect. In this context, “engulfs” would mean encloses or overwhelms, and although it is fairly common to
describe an actor as embodying (or personifying realistically) a character, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the cast
members enclosed or overwhelmed the characters they played. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “encourages”
would mean inspires with courage or hope. Although the text does mention “a strong mother and several daughters dealing
with individual struggles,” which might suggest that there are moments of encouragement among the characters during the
play, there is nothing to suggest that the cast members encouraged the characters they portrayed. Choice D is incorrect
because, in this context, “provokes” would mean instigates or incites to anger. Nothing in the text addresses provocation or
what it might mean for actors to provoke the characters they are playing.

Mineralogical differences are detectable in samples collected from two locations on the near-Earth asteroid Ryugu, but such
differences may not indicate substantial compositional variations in the asteroid. Cosmochemist Kazuhide Nagashima and
colleagues note that at the small scale of the samples, the distribution of minerals is unlikely to be ______.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. neglected
B. redundant
C. ongoing
D. uniform
ID: bce627d9 Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer. The text tells us that the samples are too "small scale" to reflect the composition of the
asteroid, which probably doesn’t show the same variation on a large scale. This suggests that the mineral composition of the
samples are unlikely to be exactly the same from sample to sample.
Choice A is incorrect. "Neglected" means "suffering a lack of proper care" or "abandoned," which doesn’t work here. The text
never suggests that the distribution of minerals in the samples would be neglected, so this statement doesn’t logically
follow. Choice B is incorrect. "Redundant" means "not or no longer useful or needed," which is too strong. The text doesn’t
suggest that the variation between the samples isn’t a useful finding at all—just that we can’t assume that the large-scale
composition of the asteroid will show the same variation. But the composition of the samples might be useful for something
else. Choice C is incorrect. "Ongoing" means "still in progress," which doesn’t make sense: the distribution of minerals in a
sample can’t be "ongoing."

Business researcher Melanie Brucks and colleagues found that remote video conference meetings may be less conducive to
brainstorming than in-person meetings are. The researchers suspect that video meeting participants are focused on staring
at the speaker on the screen and don’t allow their eyes or mind to wander as much, which may ultimately ______ creativity.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. recommend
B. criticize
C. impede
D. construct
ID: d8d1ecaa Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer. The first sentence tells us that video meetings are “less conducive to” (meaning less good for)
brainstorming. This suggests that the video meeting participants’ focus is bad for their creativity. “Impede” means “delay” or
“prevent,” which works perfectly in this context.
Choice A is incorrect. This choice is too positive to fit the context. The first sentence tells us that video meetings are “less
conducive to” (meaning less good for) brainstorming. This suggests that the video meeting participants’ focus is bad for
their creativity. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t make sense. The participants’ intense focus on the screen is the
subject of the missing verb. It wouldn’t make sense to say that their over-focusing “criticizes” their creativity. Choice D is
incorrect. “Construct” means “build” or “make,” which is too positive to fit the context. The first sentence tells us that video

Some scientists have suggested that mammals in the Mesozoic era were not a very ______ group, but paleontologist Zhe-Xi
Luo’s research suggests that early mammals living in the shadow of dinosaurs weren’t all ground-dwelling insectivores.
Fossils of various plant-eating mammals have been found in China, including species like Vilevolodon diplomylos, which Luo
says could glide like a flying squirrel.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. predatory
B. obscure
C. diverse
D. localized
ID: f83f0aab Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the kinds of mammals alive during
the Mesozoic era. As used in this context, “diverse” means to have a significant amount of variety. The text indicates that
some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals can’t be characterized in a certain way, then contrasts the view put
forward by those scientists with Luo’s research, which shows that Mesozoic mammals “weren’t all ground-dwelling
insectivores” and instead were “various.” This context suggests that some scientists have viewed Mesozoic mammals as
being all alike, or not a very diverse group. 
Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals
weren’t very “predatory,” or that they didn’t prey on other animals, since the text establishes a contrast between what some
scientists have suggested and Luo’s research showing that Mesozoic mammals “weren’t all ground-dwelling insectivores.”
This context suggests that some scientists have regarded Mesozoic mammals as all being insectivores, or animals that prey
on insects, not that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals didn’t prey on other animals. Choice B is
incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals weren’t very
“obscure,” or concealed or not well known, since the text establishes a contrast between what some scientists have
suggested and Luo’s research showing that Mesozoic mammals were a varied group. There’s no contrast between saying
that the mammals weren’t concealed or well known and the mammals being varied. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t
make sense to say that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals weren’t very “localized,” or confined to a
particular area, since the text establishes a contrast between what some scientists have suggested and Luo’s research
showing that Mesozoic mammals were a varied group. There’s no contrast between saying that the mammals weren’t
localized and the mammals being varied. Although the text mentions mammal fossils found in China, nothing in the
discussion of Luo’s research addresses the limits of Mesozoic mammal habitats.

retailers can expect robust growth in sales of those devices in the coming months. The delays are unlikely to ______ her
projection entirely but will almost certainly extend its time frame.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. dispute
B. withdraw
C. underscore
D. invalidate
ID: 1fbf276a Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the economist’s claim about sales
of personal electronic devices. In this context, “invalidate” most nearly means nullify or make invalid. The text indicates that
interruptions in the supply of microchips for personal electronics “have challenged” the economist’s claim that sales of
personal electronics will show strong growth in the coming months. The text goes on to clarify the effect of the delays on the
economist’s projection, stating that the delays are very likely to extend the time frame over which the projected growth in
sales will occur. This context suggests that the delays are unlikely to invalidate the economist’s projection entirely—the
delays will probably alter the time frame of the projection, not nullify it or make it invalid.
Choice A is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to “dispute,” or argue against, the economist’s projection
wouldn’t make sense. Since the delays are an inanimate circumstance, they couldn’t argue against a prediction about the
sales of personal electronics. Choice B is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to “withdraw,” or remove from
consideration, the economist’s projection wouldn’t make sense. Although the economist could withdraw her projection
because of the delays, the delays themselves couldn’t withdraw her projection since they’re an inanimate circumstance and
thus can’t choose to remove something from consideration. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to
suggest that the delays will “underscore,” or emphasize, the economist’s projection. Instead, the text suggests that the
delays are likely to extend the time frame of the economist’s projection but not to undermine the projection entirely.

Investigating whether shared false visual memories—specific but inaccurate and widely held recollections of images such as
product logos—are caused by people’s previous ______ incorrect renditions of the images, researchers Deepasri Prasad and
Wilma Bainbridge found that, in fact, such memories are often not explained by familiarity with erroneous versions of the
images.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. compliance with
B. exposure to
C. criteria for
D. forfeiture of
ID: 3f753a8e Answer
Correct Answer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer. "Exposure to" means "having contact with." It makes sense that Prasad and Bainbridge were
investigating whether seeing false versions of images was a cause of false visual memories. Notice how "exposure to
incorrect renditions" matches the idea of "familiarity with erroneous versions," which appears later in the sentence.
Choice A is incorrect. "Compliance with" means "going along with a command or directive." False versions of images can’t
give commands or directives, so this doesn’t apply. Choice C is incorrect. "Criteria" means "standards by which to judge
something." It’s not clear how people would come to have standards for the wrong version of an image in the first place, let
alone how those standards would cause them to falsely remember the correct version. In other words, this choice would
result in a confusing, unclear sentence. Choice D is incorrect. "Forfeiture of" means "a giving up of something." It wouldn’t
make sense to say that false memories of an image might be caused by giving up the wrong version of the image.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. question
B. react to
C. perceive
D. conform to
ID: 9c35759f Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Jemisin’s writing. In this context,
“conform to” means to act in accordance with something. The text suggests that in her science fiction writing, Jemisin’s
willingness to go against expectations and not use plots and themes that seem to follow a formula reflects how she treats
the standard practices of the genre. This context conveys that Jemisin chooses not to act in accordance with those
conventions.
Choice A is incorrect. In this context, “question” would mean doubt or object to. The text indicates that Jemisin is willing to
go against expectations and not use formulaic plots and themes in her science fiction writing, suggesting that she may
actually object to those conventions of the genre, not that she chooses not to question them. Choice B is incorrect because
the text indicates that in her science fiction writing, Jemisin is willing to go against expectations and not use formulaic plots
and themes. Rather than suggesting that Jemisin chooses not to “react to,” or act in response to, the standard practices of
the genre, this context suggests that she is acting in response to such conventions by deliberately avoiding them. Choice C
is incorrect. In this context, “perceive” would mean become aware of or understand. The text indicates that in her science
fiction writing, Jemisin is willing to go against expectations and not use formulaic plots and themes. This context conveys
that Jemisin is aware of and deliberately avoids those conventions of the genre, not that she chooses not to be aware of
them.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. consistent with
B. representative of
C. overshadowed by
D. irrelevant to
ID: 4fa7e50e Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the factors that influence peoples’
decisions to move to a different state. As used in this context, “overshadowed by” means to be surpassed by or caused to
seem less important than other factors affecting a move. The text indicates that, according to a US tax policy expert, when
people think about an interstate move, state taxes have little effect on their decisions, while employment opportunities,
housing availability, and climate have a very strong effect. This context suggests that people consider these other factors to
be more important than state taxes. 
Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that state taxes aren’t as important a consideration as other factors when
people are thinking of moving to another state. The context doesn’t suggest that state taxes are “consistent with,” or in
agreement with these other factors. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that state taxes
are “representative of,” or typical of, other factors. Taxes aren’t an example of employment opportunities, housing availability,
and climate, which are the other factors listed in the text. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to
say that state taxes are “irrelevant to,” or unconnected or unimportant to other factors. State taxes are irrelevant to peoples’
decisions, not to other factors. In other words, although the text suggests that state taxes may be irrelevant to people
considering a move to another state, the other factors mentioned in the text, such as employment opportunities, are unable
to have an opinion about state taxes. Furthermore, the text indicates that significant differences in state taxes have almost
no effect on peoples’ choices to move, but they aren’t completely unimportant.

made, deviates structurally from the wild plant it is descended from. Maize (corn), another crop domesticated by Indigenous
Americans, shows so little resemblance to any wild plant that genetic research was necessary to ______ teosinte grass as its
ancestor.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. acquire
B. develop
C. attract
D. confirm
ID: 86fbc64d Answer
Correct Answer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the identification of maize’s wild
ancestor. In this context, to "confirm" means to establish the truth or correctness of something. The text explains that maize
"shows so little resemblance to any wild plant that genetic research was necessary" to establish its ancestry, which was
ultimately traced to teosinte grass. This context conveys the idea that scientific verification was required to establish an
ancestral relationship with certainty—that is, to confirm teosinte grass as maize’s ancestor.
Choice A is incorrect because to "acquire" means to obtain or gain possession of something. Although their research likely
required scientists to acquire samples of maize and teosinte grass, the text does not suggest that this was the ultimate goal
of their work, which instead probed the connection between the two plants. Choice B is incorrect because to "develop"
means to create something or to promote the growth of something, and the ancestral relationship between teosinte grass
and maize already existed as a biological fact in the deep past, which scientists then verified through research; because this
relationship already existed, the scientists can’t be said to have either created it or encouraged its growth. Choice C is
incorrect because to "attract" means to entice something or to bring about a relationship or connection between two things,
while the ancestral relationship between teosinte grass and maize already existed as a biological fact; rather than bringing
about the relationship between the two plants, the scientists instead verified the prior existence of it.

As an undergraduate researcher in anthropology, Jennifer C. Chen contributed to a groundbreaking study challenging the
accepted view that among prehistoric peoples, female participation in hunting was ______. The research team’s review of
data from late Pleistocene and early Holocene burials in the Americas revealed that, in fact, as many as half of the hunters in
those populations were female.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A. inevitable
B. satisfactory
C. negligible
D. commonplace
ID: e8fb0744 Answer
Correct Answer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the study of female participation in
hunting among prehistoric peoples. In this context, “negligible” means not significant enough to be worth considering. The
text says that the study challenged the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples. The text
goes on to say that the researchers found that “in fact, as many as half” the hunters in the groups studied were female. The
phrase “in fact” establishes a contrast indicating that the finding that as many as half the hunters were female differs from
the accepted view. This context suggests, then, that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was negligible. 
Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as
half of hunters among prehistoric peoples were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation
was low, not that female participation was “inevitable,” or unavoidable. Nothing in the text suggests that the accepted view is
that prehistoric peoples could not avoid female participation in hunting. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text
suggests that the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples is that such participation was
“satisfactory,” or sufficient to meet a requirement or demand. There is no information in the text about any demands or
requirements regarding female participation in hunting, let alone any information about how much female participation in
hunting would be enough to satisfy those demands or requirements. Instead, the text indicates that the study challenged the
accepted view by showing that as many as half the hunters in the groups studied were female, suggesting that the accepted
view is that female participation in hunting was low. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the study
challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among the prehistoric peoples studied were
female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was
“commonplace,” or ordinary or unremarkable. Although the study under discussion suggests that female participation may
have been commonplace, that study is presented as challenging the accepted view, not as reinforcing the accepted view.
